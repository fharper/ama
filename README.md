# Ask Me Anything

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20-label%3Ahidden)

I thought it coud be funny to get my own AMA, and because I'm lazy, it's public so I can share answers to questions I frequently get...

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
